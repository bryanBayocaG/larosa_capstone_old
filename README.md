# Rental Shop Management System with QR Code asset tagging for LaRosa

### ⚠️ Note!!!

This project is **no longer** maintained and serves only as a showcase of my previous coding work. A new, actively maintained version is currently in development, featuring **React** as the frontend and **Laravel** as the backend.

## 📄 Description

LaRosa Rental Shop Management is my capstone project, built using Laravel, Bootstrap, and MySQL. It streamlines rental operations by tracking rental movements and generating unique QR tags for each gown to ensure easy identification. The system enhances transaction speed and provides SMS notifications to customers with transaction details and return deadlines. Additionally, LaRosa employees can configure the exact time for automated reminder messages, ensuring timely communication and efficient rental management.
